## Qickstart: Reproducing Figures from the Paper

_Note: Because training with `pytorch` is nondeterministic, the instructions below will produce figures that are similar but not identical to those in the paper._

### Training Models

```
cd RAnGE
source ./train.sh
```
- This trains two models: one for a uniform distribution and one for a bimodal distribution

### 2. Generate Figures

#### a.  Evaluate many trajectories for RAnGE, reMPC, and MPC
- This is only necessary for Figure 4, and it takes a while. If you only want the other figures, you can skip this step and then comment out the lines for Figure 4 in `evaluation/plot_all`.
```
cd evaluation/batch_evaluation
source ./batch_evaluate_RAnGE
source ./batch_evaluate_reMPC
source ./batch_evaluate_MPC
```

#### b. Generate plots

```
cd evaluation
source ./plot_all
```
